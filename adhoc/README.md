# Adhoc Dolt Jobs

This adhoc directory is used to house code we used to generate Dolt repositories that is not designed to be run again. 
Eventually, this type of code may be useful to check into the Dolt repository itself. Until then, we'll store it here so
we can point people at code we used to generate repositories. The code used to operate on a repository should be placed
in a directory named similarly the Dolt repository.
